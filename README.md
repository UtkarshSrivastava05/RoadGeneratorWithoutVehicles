# Road Generator Without Vehicles
This is an implementation of the task provided by SYNERGYLABS, hiring for the DL Engineer role.

## Problem Statement
Generate road without vehicle by averaging frames of a video footage.

Lets say you want to create a video where Optimus prime is running on a (real) highway, for
that you need a footage where the road doesnâ€™t have any vehicle on it, this is a problem as
the highways are very busy. But as a computer vision expert you say, wait! I can do it using
image processing, just give me a video.
